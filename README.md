# hcwc

A CLI implemented with Rust based on Unix's wc. Motivated by John [John Crickett's Coding Challenges #1: Build Your Own wc tool](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-wc).

## User Stories

- [ ] The CLI tool allows for a `-c` option which counts the ammount of bytes in a given text file.
- [ ] The CLI tool allows for a `-l` option which counts the ammount of lines in a given text file.
- [ ] The CLI tool allows for a `-w` option which counts the amount of words in a given text file.
- [ ] The CLI tool allows for a `-m` option which counts the amount of characters in a given text file.
- [ ] The CLI tool allows for no option to be passed (default behaviour) which counts the amount of bytes, lines and words in a given text file.
- [ ] The CLI tool allows for a standar input behaviour;
